# Discord.js text colorizer

This is a text colorizer for Discord.
It can colorize text. Pretty self-explanatory.\
Add the config.json file like this:

```json
{
	"clientId": "your-client-id-goes-here",
	"guildId": "your-guild-id-goes-here",
	"token": "your-token-goes-here"
}
```

_Note: Put the config.json in your root directory (the directory of the bot)_
